            <img src="../asset/pageBlog1.jpg" alt="Extracting Your Acne is NEVER A Good Idea!">
            <h1> Extracting Your Acne is NEVER A Good Idea! </h1>
            <p> Many clients ask me what is the main reason for the large red dot that lingers on after their pimple is gone?  Well, truthfully, you will always see some kind of indication that there was a pimple even after it dries up, and it will heal slowly and eventually disappear.  However, for those who love to pick, you will see much worse than a red dot, you will see acne scarring, which can last for months.
                This is known as "post-inflammatory hyper-pigmentation."  A less wordy term would be acne scarring. Each time you use your fingers to pop these little guys you invite the following conditions: bacteria to spread underneath the skin causingmore breakouts, potential to create infection, AND cause damage to the surface that will take months to get rid of. </p>

                <h3> Methods to Get Rid of Large Pimples Quickly </h3>
                <p> Adding neck and decolletage non-invasive professional skincare treatments can help minimize the damage and improve signs of aging.  One of the most effective treatments for the neck and chest is microcurrent, it tightens the skin and fascia tissue, and helps reeducate muscles in the neck area.  
                Microdermabrasion is also helpful for cell turnover in this region, as well as mild peels to help with smoothing out rough texture caused by sun exposure.  By doing these treatments monthly, and treating this region, you can avoid costly invasive medical procedures later on in the future. 
                Sometimes the damage can be extensive to this region due to sunburns or overexposure to the sun.  If this is the case, then a series of IPL sessions can be performed by a nurse or doctor to help aid in fading redness and brown spots, but keep in mind this is not a curative treatment, and the signs of aging will come back, so best to begin taking care of this delicate skin area now with good skincare and SPF used on a daily basis along with modifications to our modern lifestyle and habits.
                Skincare Ingredients for Neck and Chest:
                Keep in mind that what you apply to your face, i.e. antioxidant serums, moisturizers, and SPFshould always be applied to the neck and chest region as well to help keep it moisturized and keep skin plump, and if your skincare is loaded with antioxidants this will also help keep the neck and chest from prematurely aging.
                I have seen many neck/chest cream formulations with super high price points, but most formulations have little effect on this region when it comes to reversing the signs of aging.  But a good neck and chest cream formulated with the following ingredients can help make the difference to plump, hydrate, and rejuvenate, and some of these ingredients to look for in a good cream formulation are:  
                Matrixyl and Matrixyl 3000, containing oligopeptides and cell-messengering complex.
                Eyeliss, a blend of skin-strengthening flavonoids and elasticity-enhancing peptides reduce slackened skin tone and visibly re-firm skin that has laxity.
                Uplevity™ is a tetrapeptide specifically developed to improve skin firmness and elasticity.
                While no neck and chest cream formula is magic and will reverse all signs of aging you should at least see the skin become plump, hydrated and slightly contoured.
                All of these are in our Absolute Esthetics Formulation ofFirming Neck and Chest Cream, but they are also in all of our facial serums as well!
                Keep in mind you also need to apply SPF to both face, neck and chest since the neck and chest is exposed daily to harmful UV rays just as the face is. </p>
                
                <h3> Changes to modern lifestyle and habit: </h3>
                <p> Here are some very effective methods in getting rid of large pimples quickly without resorting to picking at them.
                Ice the pimple down for 3-6 minutes, which, can reduce the swelling by as much as 50% and it will also relieve any pressure or pain associated with it.  Since pimples are inflamed icing is the perfect anti-inflammatory solution. This is a well known trick amongst top celebrity makeup artists, so don’t waste time picking when you can ice!
                Adding a good acne spot treatment to your skincare arsenal that works to dry it up quickly so you will not be tempted to pick is important too!  A benzoyl peroxide solution at a 5% or 10% strength are my first choices for quickly eliminating large deep pimples, but you can also use salicylic acid or a sulfur based spot treatment.
                For those who already have acne scarring and hyperpigmentation from former acne, then, I recommend a series of microdermabrasion sessions, nano-needle treatments, or chemical peels for smoothing out and getting rid of old acne scarring.
